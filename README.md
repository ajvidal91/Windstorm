# Dog Photo/Name generator app

This project lets the user click the button and see the image of a random dog, paired
with the name of a pokemon card.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, $AJAX, and 2 API's

This project consists of 2 API'S/ AJAX requests, JS, CSS3, and HTML5
The ajax request for the dog API pulls a photo randomly upon the click of a button,
and at the same time generates a name of a pokemon card that acts as the dog's name

## Optimizations


When I initially pushed the project onto github it worked, however it was plain,
and not anything special to look at. I added some CSS, and now its an experience
that the user can enjoy!
